# Corrective Maintenance Application

## 1.1 Introduction

This project, **Corrective Maintenance Application**, has been developed using **ASP.NET** and **MySQL**. The main purpose of this application is not just to fix defects but to modify a **M.I.D.C product** after delivery to correct faults and improve performance.

The main objectives of the application include:
- **Utilizing experienced partners**
- **Training teams effectively**
- **Documenting strategies and processes**
- **Remaining compliant with standards**

Corrective maintenance can be performed on a wide variety of equipment, systems, and processes. For example, a technician may be performing preventive maintenance on production equipment and notices significant wear on a critical part. In this case, a corrective maintenance order can be initiated to repair or restore the part within a specified timeframe.

There are four general types of Corrective Maintenance philosophies:
- **Corrective Maintenance**
- **Preventive Maintenance**
- **Risk-Based Maintenance**
- **Condition-Based Maintenance**

### 1.2 Existing System

Some appliances and equipment can continue to operate after a breakdown due to the redundancy of components, but this leads to limited efficiency. Corrective maintenance involves technical tasks designed to repair equipment failures by either fixing or replacing faulty parts. This maintenance is essential for restoring equipment to its original functionality.

In this application, various details are tracked, such as:
- **Employee Information**: Name, address, date of birth, email, employee code, date of joining, and shift time (time picker).
- **Machine and Equipment Information**: Role name, department name, incident name, line name, machine name, machine number, hoist name, hoist number, user name, and descriptions.

For example, during routine maintenance, a technician may notice signage damage caused by a recent storm. A corrective maintenance order can be initiated to repair the signage at a later date.

### 1.3 Objective and Scope of the System

The main goal of **Corrective Maintenance (CM)** is to **prevent production loss**. CM helps to bring equipment or assets back into normal working condition, thereby minimizing the impact of equipment failure on production. Equipment failure can increase production costs, reduce product quality, and lower customer satisfaction.

The system supports both **preventive** and **breakdown/corrective maintenance** of all related IT hardware assets and network infrastructure. It can also be part of a **comprehensive onsite maintenance contract** or arranged on a **time-and-material basis**.

## 2.1 Proposed System

The *Corrective Maintenance Application* is ideal when assets can be easily repaired. CM can be integrated into a larger maintenance strategy to plan for ongoing asset care. 

The project consists of several key modules:
1. **Registration**: For new employees, machines, and assets.
2. **Working on Machine Layout**: To track machine status and repairs.
3. **Date of Joining**: Record employee joining dates.
4. **Shift Time Management**: Manage shift times using a time picker.
5. **Incident Master**: Maintain details about incidents and corrective actions taken.

### 2.2 Advantages of the Proposed System

- **No or Minimal Planning Needed**: Quick to implement and effective for emergency maintenance needs.
- **Cost-Effective for Non-Critical Assets**: Suitable for non-critical machinery or assets where downtime is less impactful.
- **Simple and Streamlined Process**: Intuitive design that reduces complexity.
- **Best Solution for Immediate Fixes**: Provides a fast solution in specific maintenance scenarios.
